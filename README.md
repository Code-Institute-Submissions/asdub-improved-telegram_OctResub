### Project Description
This project was made as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. 

I have created an app to promote the services of a freelance designer. 
Allowing users to submit requests and receive a quote for freelance design work. 

Users can also explore the designers portfolio of completed work. 
An administration dashboard gives an overview of orders and allows the designer to submit completed artwork.
