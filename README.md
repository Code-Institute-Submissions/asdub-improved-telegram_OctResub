### Project Description
This project was made as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. 

I have created an app to promote the services of a freelance designer. 
Allowing users to purchase custom design services. 
Specifically illustrations/ artwork. 

Users can select from a variety of services, select and enter their desired customistations. 
The user has the option of creating a profile to keep all their orders in one places and view or download their artwork. 
In addition, users receive email notifications regarding the status of their order. 

Site admins can add, edit or delete services. 
And also complete user orders by uploading completed artwork.
